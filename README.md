## Overview
### Description
This app helps eligible NYS voters stay informed about voting on the future elections

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Reference
- **Mobile:** Upload home address and receive list of candidates, list of future candidates, and voting location.
- **Story:** With the goal of increasing awareness of the political climate, we intend to keep US citizens up to date with the activities of their local politicians. Thus, creating a culture of political involvement and an overall betterment of the community. We decided on making the app because while the app store contains similar voting apps, they only exist for states such as California and Texas and not for New York. Instead of having to search the entire web, the app is a convenient space where the user can find all the information they need to make an educated vote.

- **Market:** We are targeting New York State residents, especially the youth/Millenials, who desire to stay politically involved. 
- **Habit:** The user may use the app frequently one or two months before the election date.
- **Scope:** This app will only be useful for New York state residents.
